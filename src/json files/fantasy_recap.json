"**Next Year's 8 Man League Week 4 Recap: The Fantasy Football Circus**\n\n**Matchup 1: Rome wasn't built in Odunze vs. Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t**  \nBrendan's squad finally decided to show up after weeks of hibernation, scoring a whopping 166.1 points. Meanwhile, Ryan's team appears to be a few players short of a full roster, managing just 99.5 points. Derrick Henry, bless his heart, decided to rush like he was trying to escape a shark tank, netting 35.9 points. Jayden Daniels, on the other hand, probably thought he was playing a different game, contributing a modest 23.9. If Ryan thinks things can\u2019t get worse, just wait until he sees his lineup next week. Brendan crushed Ryan 166.1 to 99.5.\n\n**Matchup 2: Youngh03, Big Kupps vs. Las Chubacabras**  \nBrett's team held strong with 116.5 points, while Brian's Las Chubacabras are still searching for the \"Las\" in their name, finishing with 111.9 points. Kyler Murray played like he just got back from a vacation in the Bermuda Triangle, scoring a measly 9.9 points. Meanwhile, Diontae Johnson seemed to remember he was in a game, putting up 21.3 points. Younghoe Koo must have thought he was playing golf, nailing a solid 20 points for Brett. In a nail-biter, Brett edged Brian 116.5 to 111.9.\n\n**Matchup 3: Blue Dolphin vs. Three's a Stroud**  \nNick's Blue Dolphin continues to swim circles around the competition, dropping 149.8 points on Chris's Three's a Stroud, who floundered at 107.0 points. Jordan Love made a case for starting next week with 28 points, while Alvin Kamara looked like he was fighting for his life with 24.9 points. Unfortunately for Chris, Bijan Robinson decided to take a nap instead of showing up and only netted 11.4 points. Maybe next week he\u2019ll remember he\u2019s in the league and not just watching from the couch. Nick schooled Chris 149.8 to 107.0.\n\n**Matchup 4: LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd8a vs. D:cker Til She Waddles**  \nJustin's LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd8a squeaked out a 118.8 victory against Sean's D:cker Til She Waddles, who kept waddling along with 118.6 points. Jahmyr Gibbs finally woke up for Justin, scoring a solid 19.8 points, while Sean's CeeDee Lamb decided to join the party with 23.6 points. In a close finish, Sean's team thought they could win with a single point. Spoiler alert: they couldn\u2019t. Justin won this one by the skin of his teeth, 118.8 to 118.6.\n\n**Matchup 5: Best Mahome in the Naberhood vs. Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League**  \nJack's Best Mahome in the Naberhood flopped against Peej's Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League, ending with 110.7 to Peej's 112.6. Patrick Mahomes, as usual, was a disappointment, scoring just 13.0 points while Jack\u2019s Breece Hall seemed to think he was still in college, managing a pathetic 3.8 points. Peej's Josh Allen also showed up late to the party, contributing only 7.3 points. But hey, at least Aaron Jones reminded everyone he's still on the field with 17.9 points. Peej\u2019s squad just snuck by Jack, 112.6 to 110.7.\n\n### League Standings\n1. **Blue Dolphin** - Nick - 4-0 - 557.7 points  \n2. **Bozos Dobbed Over Circus League** - Peej - 4-0 - 484.5 points  \n3. **Youngh03, Big Kupps** - Brett - 3-1 - 510.9 points  \n4. **LaPorta Della \ud83e\udd8a** - Justin - 3-1 - 480.8 points  \n5. **Best Mahome in the Naberhood** - Jack - 2-2 - 596.3 points  \n6. **D:cker Til She Waddles** - Sean - 1-3 - 480.5 points  \n7. **Rome wasn't built in Odunze** - Brendan - 1-3 - 520.5 points  \n8. **Las Chubacabras** - Brian - 1-3 - 426.2 points  \n9. **Three's a Stroud** - Chris - 1-3 - 416.8 points  \n10. **Aiyuk to be a Piece of $h!t** - Ryan - 0-4 - 410.6 points  \n\n### Weekly High Score\n**Brendan's** Rome wasn't built in Odunze takes the crown for the highest score this week at **166.1 points**.\n\n### Closing Thoughts\nNick and Peej are leading the charge like they just found the last piece of pizza at a party, while Ryan's team is in the basement, probably having a pity party. Jack's team is still in it, just waiting for the rest of the league to stumble. Stay tuned, folks; next week\u2019s drama is sure to be as entertaining as a cat video compilation!"
